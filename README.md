a project for ShanghaiTech University's admission

##ABSTRACT
In this paper, we collect the rental real estate data from the Internet and try to explore and analyse the data. We find some relation between the price of an apartment and its post date, distance from the nearest subway station, area, floor and equipment, in both visual way and quantitative way. We also find some relation between different equipment in the apartment. Finally, a price heatmap is created and some further work is proposed.
